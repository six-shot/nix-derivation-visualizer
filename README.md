# nix-derivation-visualizer  
*A D3.js-powered tool for visualizing Nix derivation graphs.*  

## üöÄ Overview  
This project visualizes the **derivation graph** of a Nix package using **D3.js**, making dependency relationships easier to understand. It parses Graphviz `.dot` files generated by `nix-tree` and converts them into an interactive, web-based visualization.  

## üìå Problem Statement  
The goal is to visualize the derivation graph of `foo` using **D3.js** to create a clear and interactive representation of Nix dependencies.  

## üîß How It Works  
1. **Generate the Derivation Graph**  
   - Run the following command to generate the `.dot` file:  
     ```sh
     nix-instantiate example.nix
     nix-tree --derivation "$(nix-instantiate example.nix)" --dot > graph.dot
     ```  

2. **Convert `.dot` to JSON for D3.js**  
   - Use `networkx` to parse `.dot` and export it in a suitable format:  
     ```sh
     nix-shell -p "python3.withPackages (ps: [ ps.networkx ])"
     ```  

3. **Visualize Using D3.js**  
   - The processed graph data is rendered in an interactive frontend using **D3.js**.  
   - This aims to provide a similar experience to:  
     ```sh
     nix-tree --derivation ./result --dot | nix-shell -p xdot --run "xdot -"
     ```

## ü§ù Contribution  
This project is part of my Outreachy application: **"Explore interactive visualization opportunities for Nix derivation graphs."**  

### About the Project  
Nix is a build system that represents processes and filesystem operations as **pure functions**, using **derivations** as its core data structure. These derivations form **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, which define dependencies between packages. However, as these graphs grow, they become increasingly **complex** and **cluttered** with intermediate dependencies.  

This project aims to build an **interactive visualization tool** for Nix derivation graphs to improve **inspectability, observability, and debugging**. Key aspects of the project include:  
- **Exploring graph layout algorithms** for clear representation.  
- **Developing clustering heuristics** to reduce noise.  
- **Implementing a multi-level detail view** for scalable navigation.  
- **Handling Nix evaluation errors and build failures** in visualizations.  
- **Optimizing real-time rendering** for graphs with 10¬≥-10‚Å¥ nodes.  

### Technologies & Skills  
- **OpenGL** (Required)  
- **Network Analysis** (Preferred)  
- **Nix & Nixpkgs** (Preferred)  
- **Linux environment with Nix & GL-capable graphics**
