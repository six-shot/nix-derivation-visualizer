# nix-derivation-visualizer  
*A D3.js-powered tool for visualizing Nix derivation graphs.*  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project visualizes the **derivation graph** of a Nix package using **D3.js**, making dependency relationships easier to understand. It parses Graphviz `.dot` files generated by `nix-tree` and converts them into an interactive, web-based visualization.  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
The goal is to visualize the derivation graph of `foo` using **D3.js** to create a clear and interactive representation of Nix dependencies.  

## 🔧 How It Works  
1. **Generate the Derivation Graph**  
   - Run the following command to generate the `.dot` file:  
     ```sh
     nix-instantiate example.nix
     nix-tree --derivation "$(nix-instantiate example.nix)" --dot > graph.dot
     ```  

2. **Convert `.dot` to JSON for D3.js**  
   - Use `networkx` to parse `.dot` and export it in a suitable format:  
     ```sh
     nix-shell -p "python3.withPackages (ps: [ ps.networkx ])"
     ```  

3. **Visualize Using D3.js**  
   - The processed graph data is rendered in an interactive frontend using **D3.js**.  
   - This aims to provide a similar experience to:  
     ```sh
     nix-tree --derivation ./result --dot | nix-shell -p xdot --run "xdot -"
     ```  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ Extracts derivation graphs from `nix-instantiate example.nix`  
✅ Converts `.dot` format using **networkx**  
✅ Renders an interactive dependency graph using **D3.js**  
✅ Helps developers explore Nix derivations visually
